## Outcomes
A Cheat Sheet covering most common threats against APIs.

## Synopsis and  Takeaways

Cheat sheets are an important learning tool because they force us to distill threat models to their most simple, essential parts.

### Identified Questions

- What are the main Threats against an API?
- Can we find common Threats that apply to APIs?
- Are there generic Threats we could check for applicability?
- Could we organize the Threats in Risk Patterns for APIs?
- Can they be summarized on a Cheat Sheet form?

### Reference
A list of threats from "Threat Modeling: Designing for Security" by Adam Shostack:

- Perform security checks inside the boundary
- Copy before validation-for-purpose
    - Is http://evil.org/pwnme.html “valid”?
- Define the purpose for data, validate near that definition
- Manage error reporting
- Document what checks happen where
- Do crypto in constant time
- Address the security requirements of your API


## A Generic Cheat Sheet for a Generic API

#### Controls  
TLS

#### Assumptions

- Multiparameter API
- Server logs requests including I.P address
- GDPR is applicable (see 2)

#### Scope

- API
- Server
- Data Flows 1 and 2

#### Out of Scope

- Provision of code
- Provision of server/hardware
(Be explicit about what you are excluding ie server hardware and software)

### Model A

- **S**
1. The wrong server responds

- **T**  Client receives tampered data
2. Compromised Server
3. Man in Middle
4. Server receives tampered data

- **R**	
5. Client repudiates request
6. Server repudiates sent
	
- **I**
Server Logs
7. Confidential data is disclosed through the connection
8. Information is disclosed through error messages

- **D**	
DoS through:
9. API overload
10. Network overload
11. Budget overload
FINDOS

- **E**	
12. Unauthorised access to API
13. Code Execution

### Model B
